# Wind Powered Future
## Introduction @unplugged
A DC motor can switch roles. When powered, it changes electrical energy into movement, like making a fan spin or a wheel turn. _But when the motor is turned by an external force (such as slowing the motor down or turning by wind), it becomes a generator that creates electricity instead._ This feature is handy for capturing wind energy. In this project, the motor is used in reverse to generate electricity which can be monitored by the micro:bit. 

**In this project**  
You will make a device to measure the voltage generated by DC motor from wind energy.

**How it works**
* Place wind turbine at different locations with varying wind conditions
    * Connect the DC motor positive (red) to GND and negative (black) to Pin 0.
* See the level of voltage generated in terms of bar graph on the LED screen
    * The greater the number of LED lights lighted up, the higher the voltage reading.

**Skills leart**
- Reverse use of DC motor to generate electricity
- Analog read pin
- Plot bar graph

## Pseudocode explained @unplugged
The micro:bit's LED screen continuously shows the bar graph of the voltage generated by the DC motor (from analog read pin 0) connected to the micro:bit at that point of time. Set the maximum range to 1023 (corresponds to the analog signal values from 0-1023)

## {Step 1}
► Place the ``||Led:plot bar graph||`` block under ``||basic:forever||`` block. 
```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    //@highlight
    led.plotBarGraph(
    0,
    0
    )
})
```

## {Step 2}
► Place the ``||Pins:analog read pin||`` block in the ``||Led:plot bar graph||`` block.  
 _(Be sure to choose the correct pin that your DC motor is connected to)_  
► Set the maximum range to 1023 by changing the value from 0 to 1023.
```blocks
basic.forever(function () {
    led.plotBarGraph(
    pins.analogReadPin(AnalogPin.P0),
    1023
    )
})
```
